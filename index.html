                <p>I am a researcher in the fields of computational optics and computational imaging. My research has focused on the use of machine learning for applications such as super-resolution imaging and metasurface inverse-design. I am particularly interested in physics-informed machine learning and the interplay between model-based and data-driven methods. </p>
